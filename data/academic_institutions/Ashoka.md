        This introductory course provides a foundational understanding of computational thinking as a problem-solving strategy, explores the core principles of computation, and introduces students to various subdisciplines within the field. Students will learn how to approach and solve problems both with and without code, with a strong emphasis on correctness, design, and style. The course is structured around two key computational models: the functional model, which views computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, and the imperative model, which focuses on sequences of instructions that manipulate program state. By exploring these two perspectives, students will develop a deeper understanding of how different programming paradigms influence problem-solving and algorithm design. The course concludes with a series of lectures that offer disciplinary breadth through topics such as information theory, cryptography, compiler design, databases, numerical algorithms, quantitative modeling, and machine learning.

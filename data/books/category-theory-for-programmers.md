title: "Category Theory For Programmers (OCaml & Reason Versions)"
slug: "category-theory-for-programmers-ocaml-reason-version"
description: >

  This book is a compilation of Bartosz Milewski's blog posts
  on Category Theory from the prespective of a practical programmer.
  It is written primarily with Haskell examples, but variants of the
  book exist with OCaml, Reason, and Scala. It is highly (and unusually)
  approachable, however familiarity with either Haskell or OCaml is
  recommended as these languages provide the window by which Category
  Theory is explored. Passing familiarity with Category Theory is
  beneficial, as the motivation for Category Theory's relevance to
  programming is assumed. This book goes well beyond Applicatives and
  Monads and fills in the gaps between the traditional abstract
  academic field of Category Theory and its implications for
  functional programming. It is well worth a read for 
  intermediate-level OCaml programmers. After all, the "C" in OCaml
  stands for "Categorical".
